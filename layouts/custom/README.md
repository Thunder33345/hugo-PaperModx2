# Collection of custom single paged layouts
You can use this to overwrite certain pages and "break out" of traditional layout.
In order to use, in your front matter set the following:
```yaml
type: "custom"
layout: "minimal" #where "minimal" is the name of the layout
```

## Minimal
This is a minimal layout without breadcrumbs, post meta, toc, taxonomy list, navlinks.
This is useful for creating a custom page with focus on content, like an "About" page.
Some stuff are enabled intentionally, comments, shareicon, title, description, etc.
